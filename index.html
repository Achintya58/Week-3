<p>During the first part of Week 3, I used a 3D printing tutorial to create a 3D vase. First, I created a line (line1) and two perpendicular lines to  line1 on either edges of it. One of the perp. lines was longer than the other. Using the spline tool, I was able to create a (2 curve) winding line from the long perp. line to the short perp. line. This essentially created a cross section of the vase. Then, using the revolve tool, I was able to create a 360 degree revolution of the cross section, which created the outside structure of the vase.</p>

<p>In order to make the hole inside vase, I created a circle sketc on the top of the vase, and extruded it all the way to the bottom side of the vase structure. Then, to seal the bottom, I created another circle, but this time on the bottom, and extruded to a certain thickness, therefore sealing the bottom portion of the vase and completing the structure.</p>

I used Arduino to control the functioning of the circuit. The circuit also consisted of a button. As per the code, when the button was to be pressed, the LED lights should both start flashing brightly and then start fading down. To be more specific, the LEDs should start a 0 volts and then increase by 50 volt increments all the way to 255 volts within 50 milliseconds, according to the code.</p>

  <h4>Modeling Components</h4>
<p>During the second part of Week 3, we were supposed to send in our components that were to be 3D printed or Lasercut. In order to get to that point, I first modeled a physical prototype using cardboard and other materials I had access to (in my house). Then, taking measurments (dimensions, spacing etc.), I created those same components on Fusion 360, and later exported it to the PrusaSlicer Program.</p>

<p>The first component (rectangular) on the left most side, will be where the canon motor will be placed on. Underneath the rectangular component, there will be a third breadboard (not shwon on image). 

The trapezoid component in the middle is the location of the safe container. As seen, it has a door on the front, and will have two rectangles with holes (Hook Locks) in the middle be attached perpendicular, one attached to the container and the other to the door. 

The right most component is where a 2nd canon motor will be placed on. The first canon motor will aid in pulling the door back to close the container, while the 2nd (or rightmost) canon motor will aid in pulling the door open. The space between the container and the third elevated rectangular prism component on the rightmost side exists, as the door will be there when the container is opened. The canon motors will have wheels attached to them, and wires runnining through the wheel and attached to holes in the door. 

There is also a DC motor that runnings perpendicular to the left side canon motor. Attached to the DC will be a tire. In the holes of the tire, there will be two L shaped rods that upon the motor running, will rotate to clear the path for the two Hook Locks to be able to separate from each other. 

In the final completion of the project, there will be wires running all over from the breadboard to the motors. They are not currently fully connected with their parts.

All components and parts are to scale. In the Fusion design, the whole floor of the safe runs 500x400. In the physical prototype, the same is true. </p>
